DartVS: Google Dart support for Visual Studio
=========

## IMPORTANT!
The current version of DartVS available to install (v0.6) in Visual Studio is very basic and uses regex for syntax highlighting,
and shells out to DartAnalyzer on a per-file basis for errors/warnings. This is not terribly reliable!

A new version of the extension (v0.8/v1) is in-progress which uses Google's Dart Analysis service and is much faster and more reliable, however it's not yet ready for release :(

- Live in v0.6
  - [x] Use DartAnalyzer from the SDK when saving any .dart file and report errors/warnings/hints to the Visual Studio error list
  - [x] Clicking errors navigates to the correct place in code
  - [x] Mostly-reliable Syntax Highlighting
- [In Development for v1](/../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.8)
- [Planned for after v1](/../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3APost-1.0)

## Installation
- Install from the [Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/69112f14-62d0-40fb-9ccc-03e3534e7121)

## Using a custom SDK
If you wish to use a different version of the SDK than the one bundled with DartVS (for example, a dev channel build), you can:
- Download and unzip a [Dart SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk/)
- Set the DART_SDK environment variable to point at the SDK root
